## Game Rules
### Object
The object of the game is to move your player to the water without getting hit by the bugs. 
### Lives and Scoring 
You start with _3_ lives. Each time you get hit by a bug, you lose a life. Each time you successfully make it to the water, you earn 10 points. Every time you make it to the water or you get hit by a bug, your player will automatically return to the start position. 
### Leveling Up
Every time you score 100 points, the game level increases and the bugs start moving faster. 
### End of Game
Once you lose all your lives, the game resets and you'll have to start over again.
